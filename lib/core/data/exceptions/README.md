# Exceptions

This directory contains custom exception classes used throughout the data layer of the Omada Contacts app.

## Files

- `data_exceptions.dart` - Contains specific exceptions related to data operations
- `exceptions.dart` - Exports all exception classes for easy importing

## Usage

These exceptions help with proper error handling and provide meaningful error messages when operations in the data layer fail. They are typically caught and handled by the repository or service layers.
