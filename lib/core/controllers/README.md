# Controllers

This directory contains controller classes that manage the application's business logic and state management.

## Files

- `auth_controller.dart` - Handles authentication-related operations
- `contact_form_controller.dart` - Manages contact form state and validation
- `contacts_controller.dart` - Controls contacts list operations and state
- `profile_controller.dart` - Manages user profile operations and state

## Purpose

Controllers act as an intermediary between the UI and data layers, handling business logic, state management, and coordinating between different parts of the application. They help maintain separation of concerns by keeping UI components free from complex business logic.
