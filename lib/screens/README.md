# Screens

This directory contains screen components for the Omada Contacts app.

## Files

- `contacts_screen.dart` - Main contacts list and management screen

## Usage

Screens are similar to pages but may represent a specific functional area within the app rather than a full navigation destination. They:

- Compose multiple widgets to create functional UI areas
- Handle screen-level state management
- May be embedded within pages or used as standalone navigation destinations
